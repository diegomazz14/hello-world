<h2> History and Beginnings </h2>
 
<p> Almost 20 years ago Microsoft was working to ensure its next operating system, Windows 95, would be a haven for PC gamers. At the time most thought DOS was the way to go for gaming; after all, it worked spectacularly for Doom and Quake.
So Microsoft created DirectX, a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that made it easy for game developers to work with Windows. It debuted in September 1995 as the Windows Games Software Development Kit (SDK) and later became integral 
to Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT. But developers stayed away from Windows, believing the platform couldn't be trusted. Microsoft threw a Roman-themed game developer conference in 1996 to convince them otherwise. It helped turn the tide.
n fact, it worked so well that by 1998 Microsoft decided to build an entire game console around DirectX. A four-man team formed out of the DirectX team created the device, then called DirectX Box. Microsoft's decision to go console was a brave move by a company known for software, not hardware.
The four men on the DirectX Box team (Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Ted Hase, and Otto Berkes) went to work disassembling Dell laptops and constructing a "console" to play games. They got Ed Fries, the head of Microsoft's game publishing division, on board as well. By late 1999 Gates was talking a lot about the console—dubbed Xbox after taking a hint from market testing.
By March 2000 the PS2 was on sale in Japan and the Sega Dreamcast was faltering. At that month's Game Developers Conference, Gates officially announced the Xbox console, though the actual box wouldn't be released to the public for another 18 months. </p>

<h2> The Original Xbox </h2>

<p> In 1999 developer Bungie Studios gave game industry reporters a taste of a first-person-shooter called Halo. Microsoft,bought Bungie in June of 2000 and Halo became an Xbox exclusive. At CES in January 2001, Bill Gates and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson took to the stage to show off the Xbox proper for the first time and announce the release date. 
Flash forward to November 14, 2001 and the Toys R Us in Times Square hosted the official launch, complete with an appearance by Gates. </p>

<p> The Xbox had a lot of firsts: it was the first console with a hard drive, the ability to rip music from CDs, and real-time Dolby Digital sound. Xbox Live arrived in November 2002 with a starter kit to get users into multiplayer games. More than 150,000 people signed up in the first week. 
Today, it claims 46 million members. Following the release of Halo 2, that sequel sold 2.5 million copies in 24 hours, making it (at the time) the most successful media launch ever, bigger than any book, album, movie, or TV show. By summer 2013 Halo 2 was the all-time best-selling Xbox game, moving 8.49 million copies. </p>

<h2> Xbox 360 </h2>

<p> The Xbox 360 was a seventh-generation console in direct competition with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii. Microsoft actually beat both of them to market in North America, Japan, and Europe. It launched November 22, 2005 in the States and Canada; in Europe and Japan it launched a couple of weeks later. \
Due to a late start in production the 360 sold out in the United States and Europe almost instantly. More than 1.5 million units were sold by the end of the year. </P>

<p> In 2006 Microsoft made a global push, launching in 36 countries, including South Africa, India, and Russia. In the 360 era Microsoft diversified Xbox Live, offering a paid online service (called Gold) alongside the free one, necessary for all the good stuff like multiplayer gaming and streaming videos through third-party apps such as Netflix. 
It also launched Xbox Live Marketplace for downloading content, Live Arcade for downloading games, and Xbox Smartglass apps for controlling the Xbox via tablets or smartphones. No 360 innovation wowed the world quite as much as Kinect. The $150 add-on mixes a VGA camera with a motion/audio sensor for users to control a game—or indeed, 
the entire Xbox 360 interface—with gestures or audio commands. It's been out since November 2010 and is so integral to the experience that the next-generation Xbox—the Xbox One—ships with Kinect in the box (the main reason it's $100 more than the PlayStation 4). The best-selling game for the Xbox 360 is Kinect Adventures, which came bundled with the device.

<h2> Xbox One </h2>

<p> The Xbox One had a rocky start, with Microsoft failing to capitalize on the momentum it had from the Xbox 360's success. And while the console was never really able to effectively compete with Sony's PS4 in terms of sales, few could argue that the Xbox One didn't end in a much better place than it started. </p>

<p> It's no secret that Microsoft's Xbox One console got off to a rocky start. Microsoft's E3 2013 presentation showed some games with impressive visuals for the Xbox One, but most of the focus was on the system's controversial "features." For the uninitiated, Microsoft initially planned on the Xbox One console being an always-online device, 
requiring players connect it to the Internet at least once every 24 hours. Not only that, but the Xbox One was going to make it difficult, if not outright impossible, for players to loan their games to friends or trade them in at places like GameStop. This combined with every Xbox One coming bundled with Kinect was not a good look for the console. 
2014 saw the Xbox One's library of quality games grow significantly, and while many titles failed to take full advantage of the new hardware thanks to them being cross-generational titles, fans did get their first real taste of truly next-gen experiences. One of the most notable game releases of 2014 was Titanfall, the debut project from Respawn Entertainment, 
which was a cross-generational game that was significantly more impressive when played on an Xbox One console. Titanfall was console-exclusive to Xbox, making it a big "get" for the company and a potential console-seller. he big Xbox development in 2017 was the launch of Microsoft's Xbox One X console, 
which is still the most powerful video game console the market at the time of this writing (until the Xbox Series X releases on November 10, that is). The Xbox One X featured beefier specs, allowing users to play more games in 4K resolution with various other enhancements. On June 1st 2017, Microsoft introduced its innovative Xbox Game Pass service. 
Xbox Game Pass lets players access over 100 games instantly in exchange for a monthly fee, and it has proven to be incredibly popular with Xbox fans, especially since it includes all first-party Xbox games on day one. The value of Xbox Game Pass has grown exponentially since it was first introduced and its importance to the Xbox brand's current success can't be understated. </p>
